***NOTE:*** This URL maybe disavailable(I strongly recommend you test it before you start this project),if you are unfortunately in this situation , you can find some available **weather url** by yourself,or you can contact me (sz.sam@foxmail.com) for a new.If you finally use a different API,The response JSON data most likely change,so you need rewrite the basis POJO class.
